The enclosed file (spce_sample_config_periodic#.txt) is a text file containing a single configuration
of SPC/E Molecules. The file is organized as follows:

Line  1       :  x, y, and z dimensions of periodic volume
Line  2       :  Number of SPC/E Molecules in the rest of file (N)
                 The number of atoms in the file will be 3*N (two Hydrogen + one oxygen per molecule)
Lines 3->3*N+2 : 
      Column 1   : Identification number of current atom (will equal [Line # -2])
      Columns 2-4: x, y, and z coordinates of current atom
      Column 5   : Atom type (either O for Oxygen or H for Hydrogen)

All coordinates and dimensions are given in Angstroms (1.0e-10 meters)
