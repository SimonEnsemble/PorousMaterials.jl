The enclosed file (lj_sample_config_periodic#.txt) is a text file containing a single configuration
of Lennard-Jones atoms. The file is organized as follows:

Line  1       :  x, y, and z dimensions of periodic volume
Line  2       : Number of Lennard-Jones atoms in the rest of file (N)
Lines 3->N+2 : 
      Column 1   : Identification number of current atom (will equal [Line # -2])
      Columns 2-4: x, y, and z coordinates of current atom

All coordinates and dimensions are given in Lennard-Jones reduced units
