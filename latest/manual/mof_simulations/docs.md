## Henry Coefficient Calculations

<a id='PorousMaterials.henry_coefficient' href='#PorousMaterials.henry_coefficient'>#</a>
**`PorousMaterials.henry_coefficient`** &mdash; *Function*.



```
result = henry_coefficient(framework, molecule, temperature, ljforcefield,
                            nb_insertions=1e6, verbose=true, ewald_precision=1e-6,
                            autosave=true)
```

Conduct particle insertions to compute the Henry coefficient Kₕ of a molecule in a framework. Also, for free, the heat of adsorption and ensemble average energy of adsorption is computed. The Henry coefficient is a model for adsorption at infinite dilution (low coverage): ⟨N⟩ = Kₕ P, where P is pressure and Kₕ is the Henry coefficient.

Kₕ = β ⟨e^{-β U}⟩, where the average is over positions and orientations of the molecule in the framework.

Runs a grand-canonical (μVT) Monte Carlo simulation of the adsorption of a molecule in a framework at a particular temperature and pressure using a Lennard Jones force field.

A cycle is defined as max(20, number of adsorbates currently in the system) Markov chain proposals. Current Markov chain moves implemented are particle insertion/deletion and translation.

**Arguments**

  * `molecule::Molecule`: a template of the adsorbate molecule of which we seek to simulate
  * `temperature::Float64`: temperature of bulk gas phase in equilibrium with adsorbed phase   in the porous material. units: Kelvin (K)
  * `pressure::Float64`: pressure of bulk gas phase in equilibrium with adsorbed phase in the   porous material. units: bar   the adsorption
  * `ljforcefield::LJForceField`: the molecular model used to describe the   energetics of the adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-host van der Waals interactions.
  * `n_burn_cycles::Int`: number of cycles to allow the system to reach equilibrium before   sampling.
  * `n_sample_cycles::Int`: number of cycles used for sampling
  * `sample_frequency::Int`: during the sampling cycles, sample e.g. the number of adsorbed   gas molecules every this number of Markov proposals.
  * `verbose::Bool`: whether or not to print off information during the simulation.
  * `molecules::Array{Molecule, 1}`: a starting configuration of molecules in the framework.

Note that we assume these coordinates are Cartesian, i.e. corresponding to a unit box.

  * `ewald_precision::Float64`: The desired precision for the long range Ewald summation
  * `eos::Symbol`: equation of state to use for calculation of fugacity from pressure. Default

is ideal gas, where fugacity = pressure.

  * `load_checkpoint_file::Bool`: Will find a checkpoint file corresponding to the [`gcmc_result_savename`](docs.md#PorousMaterials.gcmc_result_savename) if true.   If that file is not found, function will throw an error.
  * `checkpoint::Dict`: A checkpoint dictionary that will work as a starting configuration for the run.   The dictionary has to have the following keys: `outer_cycle`, `molecules`, `system_energy`, `current_block`, `gcmc_stats`, `markov_counts`, `markov_chain_time` and `time`. If this argument is used, keep `load_checkpoint_file=false`.
  * `write_checkpoints::Bool`: Will save checkpoints in data/gcmc_checkpoints if this is true.
  * `checkpoint_frequency::Int`: Will save checkpoint files every `checkpoint_frequency` cycles.
  * `filename_comment::AbstractString`: An optional comment that will be appended to the name of the saved file (if autosaved)

Run a set of grand-canonical (μVT) Monte Carlo simulations in parallel. Arguments are the same as [`gcmc_simulation`](docs.md#PorousMaterials.gcmc_simulation), as this is the function run in parallel behind the scenes. The only exception is that we pass an array of pressures. To give Julia access to multiple cores, run your script as `julia -p 4 mysim.jl` to allocate e.g. four cores. See [Parallel Computing](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/parallel-computing/#Parallel-Computing-1).

                              filename_comment="", show_progress_bar=false)
```

Run a set of grand-canonical (μVT) Monte Carlo simulations in series. Arguments are the same as [`gcmc_simulation`](docs.md#PorousMaterials.gcmc_simulation), as this is the function run behind the scenes. An exception is that we pass an array of pressures. The adsorption isotherm is computed step- wise, where the ending configuration from the previous simulation (array of molecules) is passed into the next simulation as a starting point. The ordering of `pressures` is honored. By giving each simulation a good starting point, (if the next pressure does not differ significantly from the previous pressure), we can reduce the number of burn cycles required to reach equilibrium in the Monte Carlo simulation. Also see [`adsorption_isotherm`](docs.md#PorousMaterials.adsorption_isotherm) which runs the μVT simulation at each pressure in parallel.
