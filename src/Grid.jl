	grid = energy_grid(framework, molecule, ljforcefield; n_pts=(50, 50, 50), temperature=298.0, n_rotations=750)

Superimposes a regular grid of points (regularly spaced in fractional coordinates of the `framework.box`) over the unit cell of a crystal, with `n_gridpts` dictating the number of grid points in the a, b, c directions (including 0 and 1 fractional coords).
The fractional coordinates 0 and 1 are included in the grid, although they are redundant.
Then, at each grid point, calculate the ensemble average potential energy of the molecule when its mass is centered at that point. The average is taken over Boltzmann-weighted rotations.

The ensemble average is a Boltzmann average over rotations:  - R T log ⟨e⁻ᵇᵁ⟩

# Arguments
- `framework::Framework`: crystal in which we seek to compute an energy grid for a molecule. `grid.box` will be `framework.box`.
- `molecule::Molecule`: molecule for which we seek an energy grid
- `ljforcefield::LJForceField`: molecular model for computing molecule-framework interactions
- `n_pts::Tuple{Int, Int, Int}=(50,50,50)`: number of grid points in each fractional coordinate dimension, including endpoints (0, 1)
- `n_rotations::Int`: number of random rotations to conduct in a Monte Carlo simulation for finding the free energy of a molecule centered at a given grid point.
This is only relevant for molecules that are comprised of more than one Lennard Jones sphere.
- `temperature::Float64`: the temperature at which to compute the free energy for molecules where rotations are required. Lower temperatures overemphasize the minimum potential energy rotational conformation at that point.
- `units::Symbol`: either `:K` or `:kJ_mol`, the units in which the energy should be stored in the returned `Grid`.
- `center::Bool`: shift coords of grid so that the origin is the center of the unit cell `framework.box`.
- `verbose::Bool=true`: print some information.

Overlay a grid of points about the unit cell. Compute the potential energy of a probe
molecule at each point. If the potential energy is less than `energy_tol`, the grid point
is declared as accessible to an adsorbate; otherwise inaccessible.

If `block_pockets` is true:
Then perform a flood fill algorithm to label disparate (unconnected) segments in the grid.

Then build a graph whose vertices are the unconnected segments in the flood-filled grid and
whose edges are the connections between the segments across the periodic boundary.

Then find any simple cycles in the grid. Any vertex that is involved in a simple cycle is
considered accessible since a molecule can travel from that segment in the home unit cell
to the same segment but in a different unit cell. If any vertex is not involved in a cycle,
the segment is declared as inaccessible and all grid points in this segment are re-labeled
as inaccessible.

Returns `accessibility_grid::Grid{Bool}` and `nb_segments_blocked`, the latter the number
of segments that were blocked because they were determined to be inaccessible.

# Arguments
* `framework::Framework`: the crystal for which we seek to compute an accessibility grid.
* `probe_molecule::Molecule` a molecule serving as a probe to determine whether a given 
point can be occupied and accessed.
* `LJForceField::LJForceField`: the force field used to compute the potential energy of 
the probe molecule
* `n_pts::Tuple{Int, Int, Int}`: number of grid points in a, b, c directions
* `energy_tol::Float64`: if the computed potential energy is less than this, we declare the
grid point to be occupiable. Also this is the energy barrier beyond which we assume the
probe adsorbate cannot pass. Units given by `energy_units` argument
* `energy_units::Symbol`: units of energy (`:kJ_mol` or `:K`) to be used in determining
threshold for occupiability and whether molecule can percolate over barrier in channel.
(see `energy_tol`)
* `write_b4_after_grids::Bool`: write a .cube file of occupiability for visualization both
before and after flood fill/blocking inaccessible pockets
